# Quiz-Game

our assignment was to create a quiz game using javascript. I started off with one script page. it contains all my questions answers and functions that start a timer. If a player gets the right answer they get a point if they get it wrong they lose 5 seconds off the clock. 
The quiz consists of 10 questions and the final page allows the player to enter their initials and save their score. The score is saved locally and is called back in the high scores page.
